# Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Vision

The goal of this project is to build a transparent and secure voting system leveraging blockchain technology. By decentralizing the voting process, we eliminate the risks of manipulation, ensuring that every vote is counted and recorded immutably on the blockchain.

## Flowchart

Below is a simple flow of how the Voting System operates:

1. **Owner Creates Proposal**: The contract owner creates a proposal.
2. **Users Vote**: Registered users cast their votes on the proposal.
3. **Votes are Recorded**: Each vote is recorded on the blockchain.
4. **Winning Proposal**: The contract calculates and displays the proposal with the most votes.

```plaintext
+------------------+         +------------------+         +------------------+
| Owner Creates    |         | Users Cast Votes |         | Winning Proposal |
| Proposals        | ------> | on Proposals     | ------> | is Calculated    |
+------------------+         +------------------+         +------------------+
```

## Contract Address

- **Contract Address**: `0x824d68f124F94b4A7d630bB911313fB06Bc85727`

## Smart Contract Overview

- **Proposal Creation**: Only the contract owner can create new proposals.
- **Voting**: Users can cast one vote per proposal.
- **Winning Proposal**: The system identifies the proposal with the highest number of votes.

### Functions

- **createProposal**: Allows the owner to create a new proposal.
- **vote**: Lets users vote on a specific proposal.
- **getWinningProposal**: Returns the ID of the proposal with the highest votes.
- **getProposal**: Retrieves details about a specific proposal.

## Future Scope

1. **Weighted Voting**: Introduce a feature where votes can have different weights based on certain criteria.
2. **Voting Deadlines**: Implement deadlines for when voting on specific proposals can start and end.
3. **Proposal Suggestions**: Allow users to suggest new proposals, which can be approved by the contract owner.
4. **Integration with Front-End**: Develop a web interface to interact with the smart contract seamlessly.
